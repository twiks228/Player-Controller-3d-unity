## Other
when the left mouse button is pressed, the impact animation is triggered;
If the character is in the air for more than a few seconds, the fall animation is triggered; 
when you press the space bar, a jump is triggered;
a simple UI showing how many hp a player has;
so that your character does not start playing the fall animation while standing still, put the terrain layer: Ground Layer , and put it in the character settings where the line Ground layer - Ground Layer should be!
